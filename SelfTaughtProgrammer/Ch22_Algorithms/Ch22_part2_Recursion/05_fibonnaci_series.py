"""
The Fibonacci series (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) has as its first two values 0 and 1;
each successive value is then calculated as the sum of the previous two values.
The first element in the series is considered the 0th element.

The nth element in the series, written as fib(n), is thus defined as:
n if n=0 or n=1
fib(n-1)+fib(n-2) otherwise
Write a function fib, that takes a single parameter, n, which contains an integer value,
and recursively calculates and returns the nth element of the Fibonacci series.
